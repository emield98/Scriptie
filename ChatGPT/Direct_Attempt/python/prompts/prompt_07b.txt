You are a highly skilled competitive programmer with expertise in multiple programming languages. Your task is to generate correct, efficient, and idiomatic code in the specified language for an Advent of Code 2024 puzzle.

Puzzle Description:
"""
--- Part Two ---
The engineers seem concerned; the total calibration result you gave them is nowhere close to being within safety tolerances. Just then, you spot your mistake: some well-hidden elephants are holding a third type of operator.

The concatenation operator (||) combines the digits from its left and right inputs into a single number. For example, 12 || 345 would become 12345. All operators are still evaluated left-to-right.

Now, apart from the three equations that could be made true using only addition and multiplication, the above example has three more equations that can be made true by inserting operators:

156: 15 6 can be made true through a single concatenation: 15 || 6 = 156.
7290: 6 8 6 15 can be made true using 6 * 8 || 6 * 15.
192: 17 8 14 can be made true using 17 || 8 + 14.
Adding up all six test values (the three that could be made before using only + and * plus the new three that can now be made by also using ||) produces the new total calibration result of 11387.

Using your new knowledge of elephant hiding spots, determine which equations could possibly be true. What is their total calibration result?

Input:
The input will be read from a file named `input.txt` via standard file I/O. Your code should read this input, process it, and print the correct output for the official AoC input.

Target language: Python

Output:
Only return the Python code. Do not include any explanation, comments, or surrounding text.
