You are a highly skilled competitive programmer with expertise in multiple programming languages. Your task is to generate correct, efficient, and idiomatic code in the specified language for an Advent of Code 2024 puzzle.

Puzzle Description:
"""
--- Part Two ---
The engineers are surprised by the low number of safe reports until they realize they forgot to tell you about the Problem Dampener.

The Problem Dampener is a reactor-mounted module that lets the reactor safety systems tolerate a single bad level in what would otherwise be a safe report. It's like the bad level never happened!

Now, the same rules apply as before, except if removing a single level from an unsafe report would make it safe, the report instead counts as safe.

More of the above example's reports are now safe:

7 6 4 2 1: Safe without removing any level.
1 2 7 8 9: Unsafe regardless of which level is removed.
9 7 6 2 1: Unsafe regardless of which level is removed.
1 3 2 4 5: Safe by removing the second level, 3.
8 6 4 4 1: Safe by removing the third level, 4.
1 3 6 7 9: Safe without removing any level.
Thanks to the Problem Dampener, 4 reports are actually safe!

Update your analysis by handling situations where the Problem Dampener can remove a single level from unsafe reports. How many reports are now safe?
