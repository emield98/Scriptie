You are a highly skilled competitive programmer with expertise in multiple programming languages. Your task is to generate correct, efficient, and idiomatic code in the specified language for an Advent of Code 2024 puzzle.

Puzzle Description:
"""
--- Part Two ---
Digging deeper in the device's manual, you discover the problem: this program is supposed to output another copy of the program! Unfortunately, the value in register A seems to have been corrupted. You'll need to find a new value to which you can initialize register A so that the program's output instructions produce an exact copy of the program itself.

For example:

Register A: 2024
Register B: 0
Register C: 0

Program: 0,3,5,4,3,0
This program outputs a copy of itself if register A is instead initialized to 117440. (The original initial value of register A, 2024, is ignored.)

What is the lowest positive initial value for register A that causes the program to output a copy of itself?
"""

Input:
The input will be read from a file named `input.txt` via standard file I/O. Your code should read this input, process it, and print the correct output for the official AoC input.

Target language: Python

Output:
Only return the Python code. Do not include any explanation, comments, or surrounding text.
